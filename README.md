# github-actions-quickstart

Feedback: 
I found this documentation to be clear and informative, however, there are a couple areas that could be improved in order to ensure all users are able to seamlessly navigate the documentation. Firstly, when creating the .github/workflows directory, it could be clarified that a '/' must follow 'workflows' in order to ensure that a directory is created. Additionally, when proposing the file to the new branch, this documentation does not make it clear what the next commit steps are. These could both be included in the documentation for the benefit of new users.
