# github-actions-quickstart

Author: Tiana Costello

This repository is specifically designed for Part 1 of the CIS 3500 Homework 2, focusing solely on introducing the basics of GitHub Actions for automation.

Objectives:
Understand and set up basic GitHub Actions workflows.
Learn the fundamentals of CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

Feedback: 
I found this documentation to be clear and informative, however, there are a couple areas that could be improved in order to ensure all users are able to seamlessly navigate the documentation. Firstly, when creating the .github/workflows directory, it could be clarified that a '/' must follow 'workflows' in order to ensure that a directory is created. Additionally, when proposing the file to the new branch, this documentation does not make it clear what the next commit steps are. These could both be included in the documentation for the benefit of new users.
